Description
===========

ETL is an Odoo module developed to move data between databases easily. It
can be used for data migration from different Odoo versions Not necessarily
consecutives (as Openupgrade), data synchronization between Odoo databases, 
joining of Odoo databases, and also cleaning data from Odoo databases.

ETL is an abbreviation for extraction, transformation and loading.
The module usually runs in a separate database but can also be installed in
the target database.

ETL was migrated from Odoo V8/9 to V12 so it can be installed in odoo V12 and
can move data between V8 V9 V10 V11 and V12.

There are advantages of using the ETL module such as the following:

- Can be used by functional consultants.
- Simple development, native Odoo methods.
- is an Odoo module.
- Works in most Odoo version 12.
- Multiple uses as mentioned earlier.
