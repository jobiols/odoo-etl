ETL	is an Odoo module developed to move data between databases easily. It
can be used for data migration from different Odoo versions not necessarily
consecutives, data synchronization between Odoo databases, joining of Odoo
databases, and also cleaning data from Odoo databases.


ETL is an abbreviation for extraction, transformation and loading.
The module usually runs in a separate database but can also be installed in
the target database.

ETL was migrated from Odoo V8/9 to V11 so it has not been tested on odoo V10.
