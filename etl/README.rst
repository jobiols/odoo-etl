Odoo data manipulation, like an small ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) for odoo databases.
The main idea of the project is to give functional users the availability to move data from one odoo database to another odoo database. The design is quite simple, it use native odoo methods (primarily load and export_data).
The aim of this project is different from odoo migration or OpenUpgrade, it allows to start from a clean database, merging  different odoo databases into a single multicompany db, etc.
This project was developed by a non developer so for sure you are gonna find lot of ugly statements and ideas.
It was developed using xmi2oerp tool, thanks Cristian Sebastian Rocha for that great work!

Usage
=====

* It is recommendend to delete all external identifiers on source database for model "res_partner" because when creating a user, odoo simulates partner creation and raise a unique constraint (except the admin user)
* Also could be recommendend to delete external identifiers related to product and product_temlate (except service products)
* Advisable to configure xmlrpc users to timezone zero to avoid errors
