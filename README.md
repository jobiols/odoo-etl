## odoo-etl Ported from v9 to v13 by jeo Software.

Odoo data manipulation, like an small ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) for odoo databases.

The main idea of the project is to give functional users the availability to move data from one odoo database to another odoo database. The design is quite simple, it use native odoo methods (primarily load and export_data).

The aim of this project is different from odoo migration or OpenUpgrade, it allows to start from a clean database, merging  different odoo databases into a single multicompany db, etc.

You can see several example video made by jjscarafia (in spahish) The videos are from the old odoo v9 but it looks almost the same.
