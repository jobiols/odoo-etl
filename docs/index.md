# Odoo-ETL V13 Documentation

It is about data manipulation, like an small ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) 
for odoo databases.

The main idea of the module is to give functional users the availability to 
move data from one odoo database to another odoo database. The design is quite 
simple, it use native odoo methods (primarily load and export data).

The aim of this project is different from odoo migration or OpenUpgrade, it 
allows to start from a clean database, merging  different odoo databases into 
a single multicompany db, etc.

The proyect lives in github.com/jobiols/odoo-etl Any feedback is welcome, 
if someone likes the idea, please don't hesitate to contact me so we can work 
together.
